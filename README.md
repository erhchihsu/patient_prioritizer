## Background
The patient prioritizer calculates the priority by individuals' age, zipcode, insurance status, pain level, and temperature. The program provides suggestions based on their priority scores, and summarizes the statistic in the end.

## Components
* Create a method getting patient's name through user input using a scanner parameter.
* Create a method collecting required patient information by a scanner parameter, and compute the priority score.
* Create a method calculating the priority score of the patient parameters including age, zip code, insurance status, pain level, and temperature.
* Create a method printing the patient's priority using patient name and priority score as parameters.
* Create a method printing out the overall statistics for the day using total number of patients and the maximum score as parameters.
* Validate zipcode input - Takes in an integer input. Returns true if the integer has 5 digits, and false otherwise.
	
## Technologies
Project is created with Java involving following techniques:
* print/printlns
* types, expressions
* variables, strings
* for loops/nested for loops
* random, constant
* methods
* parameters
* return
* conditionals
* while loop
* scanner
